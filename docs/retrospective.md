    - Other
        - We set up CI/CD pipeline with testing, linting, and deployment
        - We researched the algorithms we need to implement
- We set up reasonable goals for this sprint
    - The amount of workload was just right, it was challenging but not impossible
    - We are finished all the tasks just in time
- Our communication has improved since preliminary sprint
    - We were using GitLab issue board much more often
        - We set up a template how to tag issues to filter them more effectively
        - We are constantly updating our issue board to track our progress
    - We organised stand-up meetings every class
        - We talked about the progress on the current tasks
        - We planned out who is going to work on what in future
- We are still not pre-assigning the tasks
    - It works for our team since everyone can take a task that they are most interested or capable in
    - Since we are effectively using issue boards and stand-ups, this way of splitting the tasks works
