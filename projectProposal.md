# Web Development Project Proposal

Please copy this document to final project GitLab repository (**not the proof of concept repo**), in a branch named `proposal`. I will given you my comments in the MR.

(read the tutorials/gitTips.md!)

## Identification

Student participant names:

1. Mykyta Onipchenko
2. Raagav Prasanna
3. Liliane Tran Le
4. Shirley Maa
5. Paul Patrick Rabanal

The name of your team‚Äôs software company: **Spigot**

Official project name (can be changed later): **RecoGame**

Project‚Äôs internal codename (cannot be changed later): **Bob**

_n.b: A software project usually has a codename which is immune to the vagaries of your company‚Äôs marketing department. For example, one notorious version of Windows was internally referred to as ‚ÄúLonghorn‚Äù and one notorious version of Mac OS was referred to as ‚ÄúRhapsody‚Äù. The latter-day tradition of naming versions of Mac OS after cats or places in California comes directly from the much older tradition of internal software codenames._

_You should give your project a codename so that you can use it inside your software; it gives you an obvious namespace, a name for a singleton object, a prefix for whatever APIs you create, and so on. It should be something fun and memorable, but be careful, because names written in code are much harder to change than names invented by the marketing department!_



## Project summary

In as few words as possible but without sacrificing accuracy, give a high-level summary of your project:

The project requires you to import a large data set. What data set(s) will you need for this project? Please include specific URLs. An important thing to check is that your data set includes the necessary information for your project! You should look at the columns of it and see what is there!

What will make your web site unique? For example, is there a specific feature that your website will focus on? Will you appeal to a specific set of customers? (Please note that if you don't have any great ideas, it's okay üòä It's mostly just to think about the real world aspects of your program!)

- Our app is a
    - Game recommendation and discovery platform
    - Based on user profile
        - Steam integration to automatically import a user profile
        - Questionnaire if no steam account
    - Uses similarities between user profiles
    - Recommended games / genres are presented in a grid form
    - Provides a detailed game preview page with an ability to see the store page for the game
- Data sets
    - **Owned games** - `https://api.steampowered.com/IPlayerService/GetOwnedGames/v1?key=<KEY>&steamid=<USER>`
    - **Game info** - `https://store.steampowered.com/api/appdetails?appids=<APP>`
    - **Player count** - `https://api.steampowered.com/ISteamUserStats/GetNumberOfCurrentPlayers/v1?appid=<APP>`
- Features
    - Better game recommendation service than the one built into Steam
    - Platform agnostic
        - We can expand our dataset with games from other platforms
        - Questionnaire makes it so you do not need a Steam account
    - Search through steam repository of games.

    - Users can post reviews of games if they wish.
      - These reviews can be seen in the community tab, where users can see other users reviews on different games.
    - Provide a catalog for the users to nicely browse through different games.
    - View different users profiles.

## User stories

### About user personas

In order to correctly choose what features to develop and in what order, we need to think about ‚Äútarget user personas" for our software ‚Äì in other words, to classify the types of people who would be likely to use the software in different ways. Individuals may fall into different user personas over time depending on how they are using the software at a given moment. For example, if your app were a collaborative recipe book web app, your target user personas might include:

- recipe contributors, who want to write recipe profiles and put them on the site, and therefore need good recipe editing tools;
- recipe browsers, who are looking for a recipe to cook, and therefore need an excellent browsing and search system;
- people currently using the app while cooking, who may need a customized view of a recipe that they can put on a tablet propped up in the kitchen;
- recipe moderators, whose role is to do quality verification for the recipes, make sure that all sections of recipes are filled in, remove inappropriate language, and so on;
- ... and perhaps other categories?

Note that the same individual may be a ‚Äúrecipe browser‚Äù at some times and a ‚Äúrecipe contributor‚Äù at others.

Developing user personas for your own project will help you tailor your features to particular people, and to prioritize between features.

When we have figured out our target user personas, we write ‚Äúuse cases‚Äù describing how our target user profpersonasiles are likely to interact with our software.

### Example

---

**Persona description**: Recipe browser

**Name**: Bert

**Importance of users corresponding to this profile**: Very important! 90% or more of people

**Broad goal**: To find something to cook

**How the software satisfies the needs of this user profile**:

- User story  
  _Feature provided for the use case_

- As a recipe browser, I want to find a dish that I wish to cook (e.g. ‚Äústeak au poivre‚Äù)  
  _A search box somewhere on top_  
  _A profile history of recently visited recipes_

- As a recipe browser, I wish to save recipes I like in order to find them again later  
  _A ‚Äúrecipe book‚Äù_  
  _The ability to star individual recipes_

- As a recipe browser, I wish to explore the available recipes to find something interesting to cook  
  _A ‚Äúmost recent recipes‚Äù view_  
  _A ‚Äúsearch by ingredient‚Äù page?_

### Target user personas

Please copy and paste the below ‚Äúuser persona" section as many times as necessary. There must be at least 2; there are likely to be 3 or more. Note that ‚Äúadministrators‚Äù and so on are users too. You may change these personas later if you need to.

### User persona 1

**Persona description**: A casual PC gamer

**Name**: Jaye

**Importance of users corresponding to this persona**: Very important! 85%

**Broad goal**: Find more similar games

User stories (give at least 2):

- As a casual gamer, I want to see the list of games that might interest me
    - Import played games / play time with Steam integration
    - Questionnaire if Steam account cannot be provided
    - Recommendation algorithm

- As a casual gamer, I want to see what is popular among other gamers
    - Most popular / recent news queue

### User persona 2

**Persona description**: Gamers exploring other platforms

**Name**: Juli

**Importance of users corresponding to this persona**: Not so important! 10%

**Broad goal**: Find exclusive but similar games on a new platform

User stories (give at least 2):

- Same as **content consumers**

- As a PC gamer, I want to get into console gaming
    - Steam profile import
    - Grouping by genres
    - Filtering per platform

- My console broke and I can only play games on my underpowered laptop, I want to discover old games that can run on my laptop
    - Questionnaire
    - Tags (year and requirements)
    - Sorting by date

## Mockups

Insert one or more sketches/mockups of your project‚Äôs user interfaces here. After each mockup, write a list of which features from the table above are shown in each mockup and where they are represented. (You may also draw that directly on the mockup, with arrows.)

Please produce as many mockups as necessary to show as much of your application as possible.

n.b: If you submit a photo using a phone/tablet camera, please ensure it is as legible/clear as possible by taking the photo in good lighting and by positioning the camera directly above. Alternatively, you can use a scanner, or make your sketches in a mockup or vector drawing program such as Pencil or Figma.
